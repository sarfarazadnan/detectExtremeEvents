# detectExtremeEvents
detectExtremeEvents is a MATLAB script developed at the University of Strathclyde as part of a European Union’s Horizon Europe project, ‘Multi-hazard and Risk-Informed System for Enhanced Local and Regional Disaster Risk Management (MEDiate)’. It forms a key component of a comprehensive framework for quantifying diverse multi-hazard interactions. The code identifies pairs of joint extreme events for two different natural hazards (e.g., coastal flood and fluvial flood). The inputs consist of time series data for the two drivers (e.g., sea surge and river discharge in the case of coastal and fluvial floods), while the outputs are pairs of joint extreme events. These outputs serve as inputs for joint probability analysis. To ensure accessibility for users without MATLAB, the script has been converted into a standalone MATLAB application.
